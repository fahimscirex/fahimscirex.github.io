Watched some great movies recently, and I feel like I really should share my thoughts about them with others. I don't want anyone to miss out on these films. They are not listed in any particular order.

## Prisoners (2013)
It's a crime thriller, Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal are in the starring that's quite enough to make me convince watching this movie. And I must say, I enjoyed every second. Actually it's not about prison as the name suggests, it's about abduction of children by serial killer.

## Deep Water (2022)
Another one with a fantastic cast, featuring Ben Affleck and Ana de Armas, how can I ignore her? :3 The trailer hooked me in, as I couldn't stop wondering why someone would allow his wife to have affairs when he doesn't approve of it truly. I just had to know the answers. A worth watching psychological thriller.

## Bullet Train (2022)
Probably one of the best of last year, a worth-watching action-comedy. Leading roles played by Brad Pitt, Joey King, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Brian Tyree Henry. Adapted from a Japanese novel, the story revolves around hitmen who are trying to complete each of their different missions and everything jumbles up at a point. It's quite humorous and action-packed.

## Seven (1995)
I finally watched it! Don't know what kept me from watching it earlier, it was on my drive for a few years. Definitely it's one of the best crime thrillers of the last century. Directed by David Fincher, a great piece to watch. Two detectives, played by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, start working on a serial killing case. The killer is using the seven deadly sins as a motif, leaving clues for the police, but they just couldn't figure it out. And when they finally do, the story hits even harder.

## The Gray Man (2022)
When Ryan (literally me) Gosling, Chris Evans, and Ana de Armas are on screen, you know it's going to be something huge. The story follows a former CIA agent who has a bounty placed on him, and he tries to escape while uncovering secret. I won't count it more than a action thriller though, i enjoyed it, that's what matters. Although the ending didn't satisfy me.
