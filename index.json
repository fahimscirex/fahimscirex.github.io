[{"content":"Why are we seeing the name Google Pay everywhere even though the app isn\u0026rsquo;t available in our country? Let\u0026rsquo;s try to go through Google Pay\u0026rsquo;s puzzling naming scheme over the year and clear our misconceptions.\nGoogle Checkout Google first entered the online payment sphere with Google Checkout, which was launched on June 28, 2006.1 It was an online payment processing service that worked exclusively for websites.\nAndroid Pay Later, on September 19, 2011, they released an Android app called Google Wallet, which integrated the functionalities of Google Checkout with NFC for mobile payments.2 Initially, it only supported Citibank\u0026rsquo;s Mastercards within the US and even had an optional physical card that could be used as a general-purpose debit card.3\nGoogle Wallet In 2015, Google revamped its payment strategy. It introduced Android Pay on September 10, 2015, to serve as a direct competitor to Apple Pay, focusing on NFC payments, card storage, and loyalty programs.4 This move was done by Google\u0026rsquo;s acquisition of a company called Softcard.5 The original Google Wallet became a peer-to-peer (P2P) transaction app dropping its NFC support.\nAt this point, the roles were clear:\nAndroid Pay was used for NFC (tap-to-pay) transactions and was exclusive to Android devices. Google Wallet was used for sending and receiving money (only in US) and was available on both Android and iOS. Tez On September 18, 2017, Google launched a new mobile payment service called Tez, exclusively for India. This service was built on India\u0026rsquo;s Unified Payment Interface (UPI) and was available for both Android and iOS devices.6\nGoogle Pay On January 8, 2018 Google announced that Android Pay and Google Wallet would merge into a single, unified brand: Google Pay.7 For a transitional period, the P2P functions of the old Google Wallet were transferred into a separate app called Google Pay Send. In August of the same year, Tez was also rebranded as Google Pay for the Indian market, keeping its UPI foundation but adopting the Google Pay name.8\nAt this stage:\nGoogle Pay handled NFC payments, P2P money transfers (only in US), and card storage. Google Pay Send existed temporarily for P2P transactions. Google Pay (for India) offered similar services, with P2P payments powered by UPI. The Google Pay brand was also introduced in Singapore in September 2020, with a refreshed app that supported the local payment ecosystem.9\nGoogle Wallet In July 2022, Google initiated another major rebranding. The primary Google Pay app was renamed Google Wallet in most countries.10 This new Google Wallet app was designed to be a new portal for payment cards, loyalty passes, and digital tickets. The name of the app in India and Singapore, however, remained Google Pay due to their unique, country-specific payment systems.11\nTherefore, the current situation is:\nGoogle Pay is the name of Google\u0026rsquo;s overall payment system and technology. Google Wallet is the primary app in most countries for Android devices, providing access to the Google Pay system for tap-to-pay and pass storage, no longer has P2P in US. The standalone Google Pay app continues to exist only in India and Singapore with P2P, tailored to their respective unified payment protocols.

Also, one of the biggest reasons for posting this everywhere is that I don\u0026rsquo;t want others to fall into the same situation as I did. If they do, at least they can get some direction on what to do afterward.\nMy actual exam date was 7th April, which I couldn\u0026rsquo;t attend because I was so dumb that I didn\u0026rsquo;t bring my passport with me. As a result, the authorities didn\u0026rsquo;t let me enter the hall. I was about to lose the full fee, which is currently 20,250 BDT. As per IELTS policy, you won\u0026rsquo;t get any refund or be able to reschedule your date if you\u0026rsquo;re absent on the exam date.\nThe reason I didn\u0026rsquo;t know about all of these things was that I didn\u0026rsquo;t take any IELTS courses or mock tests and didn\u0026rsquo;t look at the IELTS T\u0026amp;C. My knowledge was strictly limited to the question patterns. You may say I wasn\u0026rsquo;t serious about the exam, or else I would\u0026rsquo;ve known about all of these. Well, that wasn\u0026rsquo;t the case, but I won\u0026rsquo;t try to defend myself. After all, it\u0026rsquo;s my fault.\nHowever, I was able to reschedule my exam date by contacting customer care, giving proper reasons, and paying an extra 10% of the whole amount.\nNow, getting to the actual IELTS part. As I have said, I didn\u0026rsquo;t take any course or mock test. I had some valid reasons for that. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have enough time to attend any course, and it\u0026rsquo;s a bit tough for me to spend this amount of money on a single exam in a short period.\nSo, I had to rely on online materials to understand how this IELTS thing has to be done. I prepared for a few days roughly. Now, don\u0026rsquo;t get your hopes high without understanding the whole point. It\u0026rsquo;s not like a few days are always enough to get a good score. Yes, it\u0026rsquo;s possible to get a good score without taking months of preparation if your English skills are already decent enough. Twelve years of schooling is more than enough to make you a decent English user. But if you\u0026rsquo;re not confident enough, you have to do some more work.\nBy online materials, I meant three specific things: two YouTube channels and a website. That\u0026rsquo;s all it took.\nE2 IELTS : I watched some of their videos to understand the whole exam pattern. They have short videos on every module, explaining the basics. IELTS-up Online lessons : To get ideas and instructions about writing. IELTS69 : A pretty useful website that has almost everything you need. These three things will cover reading, writing, listening, and a bit of speaking. Speaking is about practicing, so get a speaking partner or talk to yourself. Just make sure people can understand what you\u0026rsquo;re saying. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to be too hard on yourself about it.\nAnother thing is, IELTS on computer or IELTS on paper? I prefer computer. My typing is fairly good and accurate, and I am comfortable in typing rather than writing. The difference between these two options is about the timing. You\u0026rsquo;ll get ten minutes to check your answers before submitting your writing module on paper-based, while the time is two minutes on the computer. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter much, to be honest. You won\u0026rsquo;t need more than two minutes to check your answers on the computer.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all, I guess. Again, I\u0026rsquo;m not the person to give proper suggestions regarding IELTS. You should get an idea from this write-up and take further steps or seek a professional\u0026rsquo;s assessment.\n","permalink":"https://fahimscirex.github.io/jrnl/ielts-experience/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eUnder any circumstances, I\u0026rsquo;m not the person to give IELTS suggestions to anyone, but the least I could do is share my experience and understanding.

But I like to stick with mpv, mostly because it\u0026rsquo;s absolutely minimal and higly configurable. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have an UI like VLC or Pot Player, but it\u0026rsquo;s very easy to use and you\u0026rsquo;re not bound to anything, write your scripts and configure as you want. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know scripting, mpv-scripts have got you covered with a huge collection of scripts from the community.\nNow, when I said it\u0026rsquo;s minimal I actually meant it. Sure, default config works out of the box but you may want to take it a few step further. That\u0026rsquo;s where this guide is going to help you, at least I hope it would.\nConfiguration File The file mpv.conf contains all of the required configuration. The system-wide location for the config file usually is /etc/mpv and user-specific directory is ~/.config/mpv/.\nConfig file looks like this :\n# Use GPU-accelerated video output by default. vo=gpu # Use quotes for text that can contain spaces: term-status-msg=\u0026#34;Time: ${time-pos}\u0026#34; Video Here is my current config that handles the video section :\nvo=gpu-next gpu-api=vulkan vo-vaapi-scaling=hq hwdec=vaapi hwdec-codecs=all scale=ewa_lanczos scale-blur=0.981251 vo=\u0026lt;driver1,driver2,...[,]\u0026gt; By default the selected video output driver is gpu, as the name suggests it\u0026rsquo;s gpu-accelarated. It\u0026rsquo;s fairly enough, and that\u0026rsquo;s what you should use if you don\u0026rsquo;t want any hassle. But I use gpu-next, which is experimental driver and has bugs. It has almost everything what gpu offers, but it\u0026rsquo;s faster, provides better quality. video drivers can be overridden using the vo flag\nAlso there are drivers that are only compatible with X11, such as xv, x11, vdpau. Dedicated rpi driver for Raspberry Pi. dmabuf-wayland and wlshm for Wayland etc. Check this for all available drivers.\ngpu-api=\u0026lt;type\u0026gt; gpu-api controls which type of graphics APIs will be accepted. Available options are auto, opengl, vulkan, d3d11. If you have relatively modern hardware you should use vulkan, as it gives better performance but if you face issues you should get back to opengl that\u0026rsquo;s the default.\nhwdec=\u0026lt;api\u0026gt; Specifies which hardware decoding api should be used, see this for available options. Hardware decoding is turned off by default, as it requires modern hardware. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to go through which options is suitable for you, just use yes it will automatically use available decoders. If you explicitly want to specify then use nvdec for NVIDIA GPU\u0026rsquo;s otherwise you should use vaapi for the most cases.\nhwdec-codecs=\u0026lt;codec1,codec2,...|all\u0026gt; You can specify which codec you would like to use for hardware decoding. The special value all always allows all codecs. You can get the list of allowed codecs by running mpv --vd=help.\nscale=\u0026lt;filter\u0026gt; It is used to upscale the video and it\u0026rsquo;s only available if you\u0026rsquo;re using gpu, gpu-next or libmpv as video output driver. For available filters check this. Upscaling isn\u0026rsquo;t really necessary if the video you\u0026rsquo;re playing matches the resolution of your monitor. By setting scale-blur=0.981251 imitates ewa_lanczossharp filter, which is currently deprecated.\nAudio My current config that handles audio output :\nao=pipewire volume=100 volume-max=200 ao=\u0026lt;driver1,driver2,...[,]\u0026gt; Usually it isn\u0026rsquo;t necessary to specify audio output drivers, mpv does that fine. Check this for available audio output drivers. I\u0026rsquo;m using pipewire as this is what I use on my system.\nvolume=\u0026lt;value\u0026gt; Specify the default volume that will be set when mpv starts up.\nvolume-max=\u0026lt;100.0-1000.0\u0026gt; Set the maximum amplification level in percent (default: 130).\nLanguage Priority alang=en,eng slang=en,eng alang refers to audio language and slang refers to subtitle language you can add as much language as you can, mpv will follow that order.\nScreenshot screenshot-format=png screenshot-png-compression=1 screenshot-directory=\u0026#34;~/Pictures/mpv-screenshots\u0026#34; screenshot-template=\u0026#34;%F - [%P]v%#01n\u0026#34; screenshot-format=\u0026lt;type\u0026gt; Available choices are png, jpg, jpeg, webp, jxl.\nscreenshot-png-compression=\u0026lt;0-9\u0026gt; Set the PNG compression level.

Adapted from a Japanese novel, the story revolves around hitmen who are trying to complete each of their different missions and everything jumbles up at a point. It\u0026rsquo;s quite humorous and action-packed.\nSeven (1995) I finally watched it! Don\u0026rsquo;t know what kept me from watching it earlier, it was on my drive for a few years. Definitely it\u0026rsquo;s one of the best crime thrillers of the last century. Directed by David Fincher, a great piece to watch.

Moreover, you won\u0026rsquo;t have to pay a single penny.\nBefore taking you to the procedure there\u0026rsquo;s one thing you should know. Your bot will restart in every 6 hours. Cause maximum Action timeout is 360 minutes. Well, Heroku apps also restarts in every 6 hours but the main difference here is, your data won\u0026rsquo;t be stored on GitHub.\nFor example if you use ytdl to download a video usually it goes into download folder and stays there unless you delete it.

So that you can access the data of your private repo.

Also it was the first time after I\u0026rsquo;ve started using systemd-boot instead of GRUB.\nSo the thing was my /boot partition got deleted, I don\u0026rsquo;t know exactly how that happened. Cause /boot is a separate partition. AFAIK /boot doesn\u0026rsquo;t get deleted during installation. Probably it was because ABIF, that tool formatted /boot partition.\nAs I didn\u0026rsquo;t have backup of my /boot partition, I was panicked that I would\u0026rsquo;ve to reinstall Windows to restore the Windows Boot Manager.

To do that run this command.\nwarp-cli enable-always-on Or else it\u0026rsquo;s not necessary.\nTo check all available commands run warp-cli -h.\nMethod 2 : WGCF WGCF is an unofficial, cross-platform CLI for Cloudflare Warp. It works with Wireguard. So before installing WGCF make sure you\u0026rsquo;ve installed\nwireguard-tools\nwireguard-dkms (if you\u0026rsquo;re using a Linux Kernel older than 5.6)\nresolvconf (as @fazlerabbi informed me that he couldn\u0026rsquo;t find resolvconf preinstalled on some operating systems)\nNote : You\u0026rsquo;ve to restart your system if you install wireguard-dkms.\nYou can install pre-compiled binary file from it\u0026rsquo;s releases or you can install it from AUR if you\u0026rsquo;re using Arch derivatives.\nInstall binary package Download the package you need from release page. Then rename the file wgcf, make it executable and copy it to /bin directory.\nchmod +x wgcf sudo cp wgcf /bin Or you can install from AUR if you use Arch\nyay -S wgcf Now we will create a Warp account\nwgcf register And generate a Wireguard configuration using that account information\nwgcf generate We\u0026rsquo;ve to connect to Warp using that Wireguard configuration. It\u0026rsquo;d be much easier if you put that configuration file in /etc/wireguard\nsudo cp wgcf-profile.conf /etc/wireguard Let\u0026rsquo;s connect now\nwg-quick up wgcf-profile If you want to disconnect, run\nwg-quick down wgcf-profile Probably you\u0026rsquo;d like to run Warp every time when your system boots. You can do that with help of systemd\nsystemctl enable --now wireguard@wgcf-profile Troubleshoot I\u0026rsquo;m facing some issue frequently. For some unknown reason Wireguard can\u0026rsquo;t connect through my generated configuration profile multiple times. I\u0026rsquo;ve found a way out to resolve that. If you face the same issue you\u0026rsquo;ve to delete the previous profiles and regenerate new one, except your account profile. To do that you can run this :\nsudo rm -rf wgcf-profile.conf \u0026amp;\u0026amp; wgcf generate \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo rm -rf /etc/wireguard/wgcf-profile.conf \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo cp wgcf-profile.conf /etc/wireguard Now start the service again. If you want, you can set an alias for this or make a bash script for convenient usage.\nGetting Warp Plus Data for Free There\u0026rsquo;s a python script from alilapro to get free Warp Plus data. We can use that Warp Plus data in Linux also. But we need to get a Device ID to run that. To do that go to wgcf-account.toml and copy the device id. You can use that ID in alilapro script to get free Warp Plus data.\nLink your Warp account with other device using 1.1.1.1 Open 1.1.1.1 app. I\u0026rsquo;m using Android here.\nFrom hamburger menu go to Account \u0026gt; Key. Copy the key and save it somewhere else we will need this.\nGo to Advanced \u0026gt; Diagonistics (optional)\nUnder Client Configuration you\u0026rsquo;ll see a ID. Copy that and save it. (optional)\nNow we\u0026rsquo;ve to put our license key into wgcf-account.toml. Open the toml file, replace the existing license key with yours and update your configuration profile using wgcf update and repeat the previous process.\nwgcf update sudo cp wgcf-profile.conf /etc/wireguard Now you can use Device ID which you got from toml file or Configuration ID of your 1.1.1.1 in alilapro script.\n","permalink":"https://fahimscirex.github.io/bits/setup-cloudflare-warp/","summary":"\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUpdate : 23/10/2021\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026gt; As there\u0026rsquo;s a official CLI out there, I\u0026rsquo;m updating the post with instructions for that too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCloudflare\u0026rsquo;s Warp is a great service to re-route DNS query and bypass blocked website. \u003cdel\u003eThough it has clients for Windows, Mac, Android, IOS it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a Warp client for Linux.

But this movie has won my heart, I can say that without any doubt. Capernaum is a name of ancient Israeli city which was condemned to hell by Jesus. In french literature it is used to portray hell, chaos; a large mess that seems impossible to clean. Director Nadine Labaki has taken the word ‘Capernaum’ to signify the lifestyle of a young boy in chaotic, merciless Beirut.\nIn recent time more than a million Syrian came to Lebanon as refugee. Capernaum showed an important story of their lifestyle. Zain, an little angry Syrian refugee kid who doesn’t know his birth date nor his parents has any documentation of his existence. He blames his abusive parents for bringing him in to this world, a world full of mess. I was awestruck by his performance. His personal life isn’t much different than the character he played, that’s why he made the overall environment more realistic.\nOverall this movie is a debatable one also, it questions human existence. Why people take childs if they can’t ensure a better life for them?\n","permalink":"https://fahimscirex.github.io/jrnl/capernaum/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI can’t remember when the last time I’d watched a movie like Capernaum.
