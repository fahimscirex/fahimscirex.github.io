Moreover, you won\u0026rsquo;t have to pay a single penny.\nBefore taking you to the procedure there\u0026rsquo;s one thing you should know. Your bot will restart in every 6 hours. Cause maximum Action timeout is 360 minutes. Well, Heroku apps also restarts in every 6 hours but the main difference here is, your data won\u0026rsquo;t be stored on GitHub.\nFor example if you use ytdl to download a video usually it goes into download folder and stays there unless you delete it.

If you want to use Ultroid then keep ultroid.sh or else replace with tguserbot.sh.\nCreate a Private Repo Forked repo can\u0026rsquo;t be switched to private, so you have to create this on your own. This repo is supposed to contain\n.env (for Ultroid) or config.ini (for TG-Userbot) Why private? Cause you\u0026rsquo;ll keep your personal data here. You would never like to share your APIs or Sessions with others, right? BTW, I\u0026rsquo;m not going write about what will be in those files. Check their respective documentation to learn more. But I can give a suggestion, you should use Railway to host a Redis server.\nAdd Secrets in Public Repo As your forked repo is going to stay public or you won\u0026rsquo;t get unlimited Action time, you\u0026rsquo;ve to add some secrets. So that you can access the data of your private repo. Go to https://{your_forked_repo}/settings/secrets/actions to add secrets.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve to add these following secrets -\nGH_NAME : Your GitHub username.

Also it was the first time after I\u0026rsquo;ve started using systemd-boot instead of GRUB.\nSo the thing was my /boot partition got deleted, I don\u0026rsquo;t know exactly how that happened. Cause /boot is a separate partition. AFAIK /boot doesn\u0026rsquo;t get deleted during installation. Probably it was because ABIF, that tool formatted /boot partition.\nAs I didn\u0026rsquo;t have backup of my /boot partition, I was panicked that I would\u0026rsquo;ve to reinstall Windows to restore the Windows Boot Manager.

A pendrive with Windows 10 .iso burned on it.\nI suggest to use the official ISO or something closer to it. Cause customized ISO doesn\u0026rsquo;t work most of the time for this type of work.\nAn ESP partition.\nEFI System Partitions are in fat32.

If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to copy everything, just the UEFI stuffs then write UEFI instead of ALL.\nNow bootloader should be copied from c: drive to f: drive. Run bcdedit to confirm that.\nNote : It\u0026rsquo;s better to keep only one ESP. So use bcdboot on a temporary ESP partition and copy files to /boot.
