[{"content":"For media players there are plenty of options to choose from. But I like to stick with mpv, mostly because it\u0026rsquo;s absolutely minimal and higly configurable. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have an UI like VLC or Pot Player, but it\u0026rsquo;s very easy to use and you\u0026rsquo;re not bound to anything, write your scripts and configure as you want. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know scripting, mpv-scripts have got you covered with a huge collection of scripts from the community.\nNow, when I said it\u0026rsquo;s minimal I actually meant it. Sure, default config works out of the box but you may want to take it a few step further. That\u0026rsquo;s where this guide is going to help you, at least I hope it would.\nConfiguration File The file mpv.conf contains all of the required configuration. The system-wide location for the config file usually is /etc/mpv and user-specific directory is ~/.config/mpv/.\nConfig file looks like this :\n# Use GPU-accelerated video output by default. vo=gpu # Use quotes for text that can contain spaces: term-status-msg=\u0026#34;Time: ${time-pos}\u0026#34; Video Here is my current config that handles the video section :\nvo=gpu-next gpu-api=vulkan vo-vaapi-scaling=hq hwdec=vaapi hwdec-codecs=all scale=ewa_lanczos scale-blur=0.981251 vo=\u0026lt;driver1,driver2,...[,]\u0026gt; By default the selected video output driver is gpu, as the name suggests it\u0026rsquo;s gpu-accelarated. It\u0026rsquo;s fairly enough, and that\u0026rsquo;s what you should use if you don\u0026rsquo;t want any hassle. But I use gpu-next, which is experimental driver and has bugs. It has almost everything what gpu offers, but it\u0026rsquo;s faster, provides better quality. video drivers can be overridden using the vo flag\nAlso there are drivers that are only compatible with X11, such as xv, x11, vdpau. Dedicated rpi driver for Raspberry Pi. dmabuf-wayland and wlshm for Wayland etc. Check this for all available drivers.\ngpu-api=\u0026lt;type\u0026gt; gpu-api controls which type of graphics APIs will be accepted. Available options are auto, opengl, vulkan, d3d11. If you have relatively modern hardware you should use vulkan, as it gives better performance but if you face issues you should get back to opengl that\u0026rsquo;s the default.\nhwdec=\u0026lt;api\u0026gt; Specifies which hardware decoding api should be used, see this for available options. Hardware decoding is turned off by default, as it requires modern hardware. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to go through which options is suitable for you, just use yes it will automatically use available decoders. If you explicitly want to specify then use nvdec for NVIDIA GPU\u0026rsquo;s otherwise you should use vaapi for the most cases.\nhwdec-codecs=\u0026lt;codec1,codec2,...|all\u0026gt; You can specify which codec you would like to use for hardware decoding. The special value all always allows all codecs. You can get the list of allowed codecs by running mpv --vd=help.\nscale=\u0026lt;filter\u0026gt; It is used to upscale the video and it\u0026rsquo;s only available if you\u0026rsquo;re using gpu, gpu-next or libmpv as video output driver. For available filters check this. Upscaling isn\u0026rsquo;t really necessary if the video you\u0026rsquo;re playing matches the resolution of your monitor. By setting scale-blur=0.981251 imitates ewa_lanczossharp filter, which is currently deprecated.\nAudio My current config that handles audio output :\nao=pipewire volume=100 volume-max=200 ao=\u0026lt;driver1,driver2,...[,]\u0026gt; Usually it isn\u0026rsquo;t necessary to specify audio output drivers, mpv does that fine. Check this for available audio output drivers. I\u0026rsquo;m using pipewire as this is what I use on my system.\nvolume=\u0026lt;value\u0026gt; Specify the default volume that will be set when mpv starts up.\nvolume-max=\u0026lt;100.0-1000.0\u0026gt; Set the maximum amplification level in percent (default: 130).\nLanguage Priority alang=en,eng slang=en,eng alang refers to audio language and slang refers to subtitle language you can add as much language as you can, mpv will follow that order.\nScreenshot screenshot-format=png screenshot-png-compression=1 screenshot-directory=\u0026#34;~/Pictures/mpv-screenshots\u0026#34; screenshot-template=\u0026#34;%F - [%P]v%#01n\u0026#34; screenshot-format=\u0026lt;type\u0026gt; Available choices are png, jpg, jpeg, webp, jxl.\nscreenshot-png-compression=\u0026lt;0-9\u0026gt; Set the PNG compression level. Higher means better compression. Too high compression might occupy enough CPU time to interrupt playback. Check this for other options dedicated to the formats.\nscreenshot-directory=\u0026lt;path\u0026gt; Set your desired directory as default for screenshots.\nscreenshot-template=\u0026lt;template\u0026gt; Specify the filename template used to save screenshots. The template specifies the filename without file extension. Check this for further instruction.\n%F - [%P]v%#01n this template takes video filename, playback time, number of screenshot and puts together in screenshot filename.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how the config file looks after adding all of the section together :\n## Video vo=gpu-next gpu-api=vulkan vo-vaapi-scaling=hq hwdec=vaapi hwdec-codecs=all scale=ewa_lanczos scale-blur=0.981251 ## Audio ao=pipewire volume=100 volume-max=200 ## Language Priority alang=en,eng slang=en,eng ## Screenshot screenshot-format=png screenshot-png-compression=1 screenshot-directory=\u0026#34;~/Pictures/mpv-screenshots\u0026#34; screenshot-template=\u0026#34;%F - [%P]v%#01n\u0026#34; This is the absolute basic config that you can start with.\nUser Scripts mpv has support for scripting. Scripts should be put inside ~/.config/mpv/scripts directory, mpv will load them while starting up. You\u0026rsquo;ll find a huge collection of scripts created by the community in the github wiki of mpv.\nmpv-script-directory This webpage indexes various scripts which are searchable and can be filtered to find your desired script easily.\nmplug mplug is a plugin manager for mpv.

It was like I was realizing every moment, and everything happened around it.\nSome parts were related to my life or maybe not, it just feels like it is. Sometimes you\u0026rsquo;ll never know what something meant to you until you lose it. For Davis, it was her wife, though he told some people he never loved her wife, but deep inside something was eating him out when she was not around him anymore. He started to notice every small thing happening around himself.\nHe was struggling to figure out why he thinks he wasn’t in love with her wife. Digging deep inside him, he wanted to look what’s the matter. Tearing apart all memories demolishing his earlier self, he tried to bring out something meaningful.\nIt seems true that sadness touches you more easily. I should be saying “Melancholy” instead of sadness, I guess. Yes, that’s the word, it belongs here. Human emotions are too complex to understand.\nTo me, life is about living it. When something stands ahead of you, you don’t stop, continuing the living process is life. And when others join you in that journey, it gets even better, more bearable.

I don\u0026rsquo;t want anyone to miss out on these films. They are not listed in any particular order.\nPrisoners (2013) It\u0026rsquo;s a crime thriller, Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal are in the starring that\u0026rsquo;s quite enough to make me convince watching this movie. And I must say, I enjoyed every second. Actually it\u0026rsquo;s not about prison as the name suggests, it\u0026rsquo;s about abduction of children by serial killer.\nDeep Water (2022) Another one with a fantastic cast, featuring Ben Affleck and Ana de Armas, how can I ignore her? :3 The trailer hooked me in, as I couldn\u0026rsquo;t stop wondering why someone would allow his wife to have affairs when he doesn\u0026rsquo;t approve of it truly. I just had to know the answers. A worth watching psychological thriller.\nBullet Train (2022) Probably one of the best of last year, a worth-watching action-comedy. Leading roles played by Brad Pitt, Joey King, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Brian Tyree Henry. Adapted from a Japanese novel, the story revolves around hitmen who are trying to complete each of their different missions and everything jumbles up at a point. It\u0026rsquo;s quite humorous and action-packed.\nSeven (1995) I finally watched it! Don\u0026rsquo;t know what kept me from watching it earlier, it was on my drive for a few years. Definitely it\u0026rsquo;s one of the best crime thrillers of the last century. Directed by David Fincher, a great piece to watch. Two detectives, played by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, start working on a serial killing case. The killer is using the seven deadly sins as a motif, leaving clues for the police, but they just couldn\u0026rsquo;t figure it out. And when they finally do, the story hits even harder.\nThe Gray Man (2022) When Ryan (literally me) Gosling, Chris Evans, and Ana de Armas are on screen, you know it\u0026rsquo;s going to be something huge. The story follows a former CIA agent who has a bounty placed on him, and he tries to escape while uncovering secret. I won\u0026rsquo;t count it more than a action thriller though, i enjoyed it, that\u0026rsquo;s what matters.

Cause maximum Action timeout is 360 minutes. Well, Heroku apps also restarts in every 6 hours but the main difference here is, your data won\u0026rsquo;t be stored on GitHub.\nFor example if you use ytdl to download a video usually it goes into download folder and stays there unless you delete it.

And we\u0026rsquo;re done with onedriver here, rest of the post is about onedrive or you can say onedrive-abraunegg.\nSetup We need a config file to use onedrive properly, package comes with a config, we\u0026rsquo;ve to copy that to user config folder.\n$ mkdir -p ~/.config/onedrive/ $ cp /usr/share/doc/onedrive/config ~/.config/onedrive/config You may want to edit the config file, so that anything doesn\u0026rsquo;t go wrong. I\u0026rsquo;ll suggest you to change sync_dir to different location and upload_only and no_remote_delete to true. But if you\u0026rsquo;re willing to store your cloud data to your local system you should keep upload_only unchanged.\nNow put some files in your sync folder or if you already have data in your cloud simply run $ onedrive --synchronization and your sychronization will start. Also you can run $ onedrive -m it will monitor changes in sync directory and will sync automatically.\nIf you change the filters (skip_file or skip_dir in your configs) you must execute $onedrive --synchronize --resync.\nSystemd Intigration It\u0026rsquo;s convenient to start onedrive as a systemd service.\nEnable service as root user\n$ systemctl enable --now onedrive Or,\nEnable as non-root user (recommended)\n$ systemctl --user enable --now onedrive To stop the service\n$ systemctl --user disable --now onedrive If you think you need more detailed instruction for usage check the GitHub repo.\n","permalink":"https://fahimscirex.github.io/bits/onedrive-synchronization/","summary":"OneDrive doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any official client in Linux.

It is used to move the font to the up or to the down. Negative value will move it to the down.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s assume I\u0026rsquo;m having problem with a Spotify module icon in my panel. That icon is way big than others. So i\u0026rsquo;m gonna fix that by changing the icon font size. Usually Nerd Fonts is used in Polybar to get a icon, so I\u0026rsquo;m gonna choose Iosevka Nerd Font.

Though it has clients for Windows, Mac, Android, IOS it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a Warp client for Linux. Still we can use an unofficial client to get our work done. It has clients for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, IOS. You can use it in Linux through the official CLI client or with WGCF.\nMethod 1 : WARP Desktop Client Head over to this page and follow the instructions to setup repository for your distro.\nInstallation Ubuntu : sudo apt install cloudflare-warp RHEL/CentOS : sudo yum install cloudflare-warp Arch : yay -Syu cloudflare-warp-bin Register and Connect You have to register for the first time\nwarp-cli register Now connect to WARP\nwarp-cli connect Run curl https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/trace/ if the output shows warp=on you\u0026rsquo;re successfully connected to WARP.\nTo disconnect from WARP\nwarp-cli disconnect Enable Service You can enable WARP service if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to enter password after every boot.\nsystemctl enable --now warp-svc Always Stay Connected to WARP You may want to use WARP all the time. To do that run this command.\nwarp-cli enable-always-on Or else it\u0026rsquo;s not necessary.\nTo check all available commands run warp-cli -h.\nMethod 2 : WGCF WGCF is an unofficial, cross-platform CLI for Cloudflare Warp. It works with Wireguard. So before installing WGCF make sure you\u0026rsquo;ve installed\nwireguard-tools\nwireguard-dkms (if you\u0026rsquo;re using a Linux Kernel older than 5.6)\nresolvconf (as @fazlerabbi informed me that he couldn\u0026rsquo;t find resolvconf preinstalled on some operating systems)\nNote : You\u0026rsquo;ve to restart your system if you install wireguard-dkms.\nYou can install pre-compiled binary file from it\u0026rsquo;s releases or you can install it from AUR if you\u0026rsquo;re using Arch derivatives.\nInstall binary package Download the package you need from release page. Then rename the file wgcf, make it executable and copy it to /bin directory.\nchmod +x wgcf sudo cp wgcf /bin Or you can install from AUR if you use Arch\nyay -S wgcf Now we will create a Warp account\nwgcf register And generate a Wireguard configuration using that account information\nwgcf generate We\u0026rsquo;ve to connect to Warp using that Wireguard configuration. It\u0026rsquo;d be much easier if you put that configuration file in /etc/wireguard\nsudo cp wgcf-profile.conf /etc/wireguard Let\u0026rsquo;s connect now\nwg-quick up wgcf-profile If you want to disconnect, run\nwg-quick down wgcf-profile Probably you\u0026rsquo;d like to run Warp every time when your system boots. You can do that with help of systemd\nsystemctl enable --now wireguard@wgcf-profile Troubleshoot I\u0026rsquo;m facing some issue frequently. For some unknown reason Wireguard can\u0026rsquo;t connect through my generated configuration profile multiple times. I\u0026rsquo;ve found a way out to resolve that. If you face the same issue you\u0026rsquo;ve to delete the previous profiles and regenerate new one, except your account profile. To do that you can run this :\nsudo rm -rf wgcf-profile.conf \u0026amp;\u0026amp; wgcf generate \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo rm -rf /etc/wireguard/wgcf-profile.conf \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo cp wgcf-profile.conf /etc/wireguard Now start the service again. If you want, you can set an alias for this or make a bash script for convenient usage.\nGetting Warp Plus Data for Free There\u0026rsquo;s a python script from alilapro to get free Warp Plus data. We can use that Warp Plus data in Linux also. But we need to get a Device ID to run that. To do that go to wgcf-account.toml and copy the device id. You can use that ID in alilapro script to get free Warp Plus data.\nLink your Warp account with other device using 1.1.1.1 Open 1.1.1.1 app. I\u0026rsquo;m using Android here.\nFrom hamburger menu go to Account \u0026gt; Key. Copy the key and save it somewhere else we will need this.\nGo to Advanced \u0026gt; Diagonistics (optional)\nUnder Client Configuration you\u0026rsquo;ll see a ID. Copy that and save it. (optional)\nNow we\u0026rsquo;ve to put our license key into wgcf-account.toml. Open the toml file, replace the existing license key with yours and update your configuration profile using wgcf update and repeat the previous process.\nwgcf update sudo cp wgcf-profile.conf /etc/wireguard Now you can use Device ID which you got from toml file or Configuration ID of your 1.1.1.1 in alilapro script.\n","permalink":"https://fahimscirex.github.io/bits/setup-cloudflare-warp/","summary":"Update : 23/10/2021 \u0026gt; As there\u0026rsquo;s a official CLI out there, I\u0026rsquo;m updating the post with instructions for that too.\nCloudflare\u0026rsquo;s Warp is a great service to re-route DNS query and bypass blocked website.
