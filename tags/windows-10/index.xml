      <description>Few days ago I installed Archcraft again. The latest update has some cool stuffs, I wanted to try them. As usual both of my bootloader was gone, I use a dual booted system. I&amp;rsquo;ve faced that issue many times and fixed that on my own. But this time it was a litte different, this happened for the first time after switching to UEFI from Legacy. Also it was the first time after I&amp;rsquo;ve started using systemd-boot instead of GRUB.
So the thing was my /boot partition got deleted, I don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly how that happened.</description>
